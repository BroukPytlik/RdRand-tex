\chapter{Performance testing} \label{sec:performance}
In RedHat I had access to machines on which I could test the library. 

\TODO{measure also times for getting one number, one KiB...}

\section{Half performance on some machines}

\section{Underflow}
The only machine on which I was able to achieve underflow of the HW RNG is \machine{dell-pr1700-02.lab.bos.redhat.com}.


\section{Specifications of referenced machines}
\machineDeclare{dell-pr1700-02.lab.bos.redhat.com}{Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E3-1285 v3 @ 3.60GHz}{The internal RNG is not able to handle more than four parallel threads at November 2013.}
