\chapter{Functional Tests} \label{chap:tests}
For the need of performance testing we wrote at first a testing application, as well as small set of scripts for automating of tests. And after getting the code on decent performance, we also used some statistical tests batteries, more information about them you can find in \fullref{chap:statistical-testing}. Later the rdrand-gen application was also created and tested, but it was already described in \fullref{chap:generator} as it is not a test application.

\subsection{Performance test}
Because the performance of the RNG is important, we needed to check the performance during the development on different machines and with different amount of threads. With manual testing it would be difficult to test the library in range (for example) from 1 to 120 threads.

\subsection{Scripts}
The set of Bash and Python scripts is there for automatic run of the throughput test with different count of threads, parsing the values and then creating a graph. You can see the outputs in \fullref{chap:performance}.
