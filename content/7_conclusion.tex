\chapter{Conclusion}
The RdRand is a~good source of entropy, with potential to~make our Communication
a~little more secure. Unfortunately, relevations about NSA and other agencies 
throws a shadow on this technology. One of the possible ways to eliminate possible
compromitation is encrypting the generated values by AES in counter mode. 
This option is implemented in later versions of the library, than was described here.
