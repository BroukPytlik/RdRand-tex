\chapter{The RdRand instruction}  \label{chap:rdrand-instruction}
\par{
First public information about RdRand came sometime during year 
2011\cite{IntelRdRandFindAbout}, a~year before the~CPUs with it were released
 and Intel itself send patches to add support into Linux in summer of~the~same 
 year\cite{KernelRdRand}. Later, RdRand was added between Linux entropy 
 sources for {\tt /dev/[u]random}. According to known 
 information~\cite{TheodoreTsoNSA}, Intel tried to have {\tt /dev/[u]random} rely
  only on their instruction, but that was denied. 
}

\par{
After disclosure of~extends of~NSA spying activities by Edward Snowden 
in summer of~2013\cite{GuardianNSA,DailymailNSA}, a~petition for removing 
RdRand from Linux entropy sources was created~\cite{PetitionRdRand}. 
Although supported by just 8 signatures, it got wide attention on 
information-technology aimed news pages and magazines, like Slashdot.org~\cite{PetitionRdRandSlashdot}. The petition was closed after Linus Torvalds 
responds with scorn:

Short answer: we actually know what we are doing. You don't.
}
\par{
Long answer: we use rdrand as \_one\_ of~many inputs into the~random pool, 
and we use it as a~way to \_improve\_ that random pool. 
So even if rdrand were to be back-doored by the~NSA, our use of~rdrand 
actually improves the~quality of~the~random numbers you get 
from {\tt /dev/random}.

\section{History}\label{sec:intel-history}
\par{
This is not for the first time Intel is producing a HW RNG. Around 1999, 
their chipsets of 8xx series had a TRNG~\cite{Intel810Manual}[chapter 1.3.5]\cite{RNGTools} 
as part of the Intel FWH (82802AB or 82802AC) component.
This RNG was analog -- a thermal noise was affecting a resistor. 
The noise was amplified and forwarded to a voltage--controlled oscillator. 
Its output was combined with another oscillator with much higher frequency 
and the drift between these two frequencies provided the requested entropy~\cite{IntelRNGAnalysis}.
}
\par{
Pairs of generated bits were digitally processed, using Von Neumann Corrector to enhance its statistical properties by removing some bias. Due to this, the RNG has a variable bitrate, averaging around 75 Kbit/sec.

\section{Intel Secure Key}\label{sec:intel-secure-key}
\par{
The Intel Secure Key (ISK) uses cascade construction, combining a~HW RNG
 with CSPRNG into one sealed block on CPU, which is compliant with many 
 security standards, including NIST SP800-90, FIPS-140-2, and ANSI 
X9.82\cite{IntelDRNGGuide}. Although it is impossible to audit it, there was found 
 no evidence of~low entropy or anything that would deny the~security standards 
 compliance - neither with tests in \fullref{sec:testing:stat-testing}, nor any other 
 tests anyone else did\footnote{I assume that such revelation would become 
 quickly known and broadly discussed, but all tests I have found have 
 the same conclusion as mine.}.
 }

% --------------------------------------------------------
\section{Physical Implementation}\label{sec:ISK-physical}
\par{
One important thing about ISK with a big impact on the performance, but also price 
of~that solution is that there is only one unit on a~die and the~unit should be
 the~same on all CPUs\footnote{We didn't find the "be the same" officially confirmed and it can change in future CPUs. But empirical test results made on range of different CPU types provided the same characteristics, with exception of Intel Xeon CPUs as is described in the \ref{chap:testing}.}.~\cite{IntelDRNGGuide}[Chapter 3.1]
Because all processing units (PUs)\footnote{Two physical cores with 
hyper-threading counts as four PUs.} on one die share the~RNG, one thread 
reading random numbers from it can never be faster than 
$Total speed  \frac{1}{PUs}$. The effect of~this is that the~performance is
 scalable until amount of PUs and the maximum output speed are exceeded 
 (see \fullref{sec:testing:performance-testing}), and price of~the~CPU is less 
 affected.
}

\par{
Each ISK unit consists three basic parts: A hardware entropy source, 
a~conditioner and a~{\em deterministic random bit generator} (DRBG)
\cite{IntelDRNGGuide}. The frequency of~the~RNG is independent 
on the~rest of~the~CPU and is set to 800 MHz.

\subsection{Entropy Source}
\par{
The entropy source is a~metastable circuit, with unpredictable behavior based 
on thermal noise.~\cite{UnderstandingRdRandElectronic}
In figure~\ref{fig:ES-circuit}, the~middle (red) part is the~heart 
of~the~circuit, a~RS-NOR latch. As its {\em reset} and {\em set} inputs 
are wired together, when an impulse is brought on these inputs, the~latch sets 
to 1 or 0 based on thermal noise. To provide better distribution, there is 
the~bottom (blue) negative feedback. Based on the~output of~the~latch, charge 
on capacitors in the~negative feedback is adjusted and then this negative 
feedback slightly shift the~chance for next bit to be opposite. The longer 
is a~sequence of~the~same bits, the~higher charge is on the~capacitors 
and bigger effect it has.
}

\par{
Finally, when the~latch is settled in one state, the~top (green) part 
of~the~circuit detect it, saves the~bit (and send it further), wait 
a~little time and then it sends a~pulse on the~R/S inputs of~the~latch 
to produce a~new bit. This entropy source has its own frequency, different 
from the~rest of~the~RNG, about 3~GHz.
}

\label{fig:ES-circuit}
\end{figure}

% ....................................................
\subsection{Conditioner}
\par{
The entropy source provides random bits with some entropy, 
but due to implementation and the~feedback, it can be unbalanced 
and produce values in something close to oscillating patterns. 
For this reason, there is the~conditioner that adds them to a~256 bit pool, 
make a~set of~XOR and AES operations over lower and upper half of~the~pool 
and test health of~the~pool\footnote{The health check is done by counting six 
different bit patterns in the~256--bit pool and comparing the~counts 
with empirically chosen values. The pool is healthy only if the~numbers are 
in the~specified ranges.
}~\cite{AnalysisOfDRNG,UnderstandingRdRandElectronic}. 
If the~pool is not healthy, the~set of~operations is repeated. 
}
% ....................................................
\subsection{DRBG}\label{subsec:DRBG}
\par{
Because the~output speed of~the~conditioner is too slow (just 256 bits per few 
microseconds), 
a~deterministic random bit generator is connected to the~256 bit pool 
and every few microseconds (if the~pool is healthy) takes it as a~new seed. 
This pseudo random generator then computes 65.536 bits values using 
a 128-bit AES and put them to a~output buffer. 
From there, they can be taken by the~RdRand instruction after 64-bit 
blocks\footnote{64 bits are always taken out, no matter what size is 
the~target register of~the~instruction. Thus, it is not possible to achieve the full 
speed of the DRBG on 32-bit system, as there is no difference for the Intel 
Secure Key usage from pulling 64 bits. Just some bits are thrown away. 
See \fullref{subsec:testing:differences} for a performance test.}~\cite{AnalysisOfDRNG,UnderstandingRdRandElectronic}. 
Reseeding of~the~DRBG is required after all 1024 blocks are used, 
but usually it will reseed more frequently, 
about each 10 microseconds.~\cite[Chapter~4.4]{IntelDRNGGuide}
}
% ....................................................
\subsection{Built-in Self-Tests (BIST)}
\par{
Intel Secure Key contains also built-in self-tests. After a reset, the BIST at first test 
health of the DRBG and conditioner, then it tests the entropy source. In the first 
part, ES is disconnected, a previously determined bit sequence is 'generated' 
and the BIST checks the output with a built-in value. In second phase, 
the entropy source is connected and few sequences are generated. 
If the entropy source would be bad, the previously checked health check in conditioner would detect it. 
}

\par{
In case one of the BIST parts would not be finished correctly and the RdRand 
instruction is called, just zeros are returned and carry flag is cleared.~\cite{AnalysisOfDRNG}
}

% --------------------------------------------------------
\section{Existing Usages} 
\par{
RdRand is already used in Linux kernel for the both blocking and non-blocking pools. For the non-blocking pool({\tt /dev/urandom}), it is possible to completely feed the pool with RdRand.~\cite{KernelRdRand} For blocking pool ({\tt /dev/random}), the RdRand is used as one from more entropy sources in {\tt drivers/char/random.c}.
}

for (i = 0; i < LONGS(20); i++) {
	unsigned long v;
	if (!arch_get_random_long(&v))
		break;
	hash.l[i] ^= v;
}
\end{lstlisting}

\par{
Another well-known and widely spread system already using RdRand is OpenSSL. This library added the support in version 1.0.1.~\cite{OpenSSLRandomNumbers}[Chapter 3.2 Generation] There the RdRand is provided as one engine of many and requires to be explicitly enabled.
}

OPENSSL_cpuid_setup();
ENGINE_load_rdrand();
ENGINE* eng = ENGINE_by_id("rdrand");
ENGINE_init(eng);
ENGINE_set_default(eng, ENGINE_METHOD_RAND);

// Here use the engine with some RAND_ method

ENGINE_finish(eng);
ENGINE_free(eng);
ENGINE_cleanup();
\end{lstlisting}

\par{
In Windows 8, RdRand is used for example during boot for {\tt ASLR} {\em (Address Space Layout Randomization)}.~\cite{WindowsASLR,WindowsHeap}
}

% --------------------------------------------------------
\section{Security}\label{sec:security}
\par{
Security of the RNG is important, but it is hard to check. During the last few years,
 the possibility of hardware Trojans (malicious manipulation during 
 the manufacturing process) gained attention, but none was yet found. This doesn't 
necessarily means that no such exists, because detection methods are 
much more difficult than with their software kindreds, and frequently destructive. 
}

\par{
If such Trojan is not detected in software because of altering verifiable outputs 
(like AES HW Acceleration, which would not encrypt the data), 
there is not much other ways, than to slice the chip and optically inspect it. 
The verification against a "golden chip" is expensive, destructive and slow 
and requires to have the "golden", trusted chip for comparison.
Yet it can find alterations in circuits that could open some backdoors. 
But recently, another possible attack vector was described by international group
 of scientists in their work {\em Stealthy Dopant-Level Hardware Trojans}~\cite{DopantAttack} 
 in which they directly presented such attack on the Intel's RdRand.
}

\par{
The new category of attack is not modifying the circuits layout 
and is undetectable by the optical inspections, because it affects the functionality
 of transistors instead changing the layout. By slight changes 
 in doping\footnote{Doping means adding specific impurities to the clear silicon 
 to change its electric properties.}, the modified gate can become static.
}

\par{
While with a correct RdRand an attacker has a chance of $ 1/2^{128}$ to correctly guess 
a random number, the described attack could increase the chance to 
$ 1/2^n$~\cite{DopantAttack}[Chap. 3.2, page 9], but the output of such
 modified RdRand is still looking randomly. In the work is achieved  
 $n = 32$, while it still pass NIST random number test suite.
}

\par{
This kind of attack (predictability) is different from what the authors of the petition~\cite{PetitionRdRand} for removing RdRand from {\tt /dev/random} fears. Their point is that RdRand, as a part of the CPU, can actively try to reduce entropy of the pool. If it would know with what values it will be XORed (they can be in cache of the CPU), it can produce inverted value and effectively impact the pool. But I don't have enough understanding of this Linux subsystem to be able to evaluate this claim.
