\begin{description}
 \item [ASLR --] Address Space Layout Randomization. Security mechanism involving randomisation of memory addresses of various system data structures to make it harder to change them in an attack.
 \item [RNG --] Random number generator.
 \item [PRNG --] Pseudorandom number generator.
 \item [CSPRNG --] Cryptographicaly secure PRNG.
 \item [TRNG --] True random number generator.
 \item [LCRNG --] Linear congruential random number generator -- a basic PRNG,
 	probably most widely used~\cite[p.~151]{CryptographyAndNetworkSecurity}.
 \item [LRNG --] Linux Random Number Generator -- a RNG used in Linux Kernel.
 \item [Entropy --] Measure of disorder and uncertainty of a system. 
 	In this report the term {\em entropy} can also refer to a random value itself 
	from an information source. See \fullref{chap:randomNumbers}.
\item [PU --] Processing Unit. A CPU with 2 cores and Hyper--Threading has 4 PUs.
